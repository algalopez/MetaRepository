Introduction to Functional programming (*For fun and joy*)

## What is it

When Richard Feynmann wanted to learn a new topic and ensure he understood it well enough, he applied this technique:

    Choose a concept you want to learn about.
    Pretend you are teaching it to a student in grade 6.
    Identify gaps in your explanation; Go back to the source material, to better understand it.
    Review and simplify (optional)

This mini project is my attempt to use the Feynmann technique to learning the basics about functional programming
